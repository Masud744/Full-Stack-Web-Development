        <h2>Inqilab Moncho</h2>
        <p>Inqilab Moncho is a youth and uprising-inspired platform which emerged from the students and citizens' mobilisation around the July protests in Bangladesh. The organisation's stated aims include defending the country's independence and sovereignty, opposing all forms of domination, and building a "justice-based state".[19][20] Inqilab Moncho joined a broader network of youth platforms and alliances calling for accountability for protest-related killings and for a ban on the Awami League. Several reports have identified Inqilab Moncho as part of the "July Unity coalition", a grouping of youth and civil society platforms formed in the aftermath of the July protests.[21]

Hadi was an active participant in the July Revolution and after the protests, he emerged as one of the visible young organisers demanding accountability for protest-related deaths. He accused certain opposition groups of attempting to dominate the movement and criticised what he characterised as corruption among some youth political leaders.[22]</p>
